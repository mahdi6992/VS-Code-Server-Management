## What is VS Code Server?

VS Code Server is an open-source version of Visual Studio Code that runs in the browser. Developed by Coder, it allows you to set up the powerful VS Code IDE on a server and access it through any web browser.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Access from Any Device**: Access your development environment from any device with a web browser - even mobile phones, tablets, or older computers.

2. **Centralized Code Storage**: All your projects and code are stored on the server, eliminating the need for synchronization or worrying about code loss.

3. **Enhanced Security**: Your code never leaves your server, everything runs on your infrastructure.

4. **Full VS Code Features**: Nearly all VS Code features including:
   - Extensions installation
   - IntelliSense (code completion)
   - Integrated terminal
   - Debugger and Git tools
   - File management and project execution

5. **High Performance**: All code processing and program execution happens on the server, reducing load on your local computer.

## Quick Start
